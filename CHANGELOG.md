# Changelog

All notable changes to Streamn Scoreboard will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Home player stats for hockey, kept in their own **Home Players** window opened from one **Player Stats / Roster...** button in the dock. The window shows the whole roster, two players per row, and stays open while you work. Only the home team is tracked.
- After every goal, home or away, a window asks which players were on the ice and plus/minus is updated: +1 for a home goal, -1 for an away goal. Every box starts empty for each goal, and Skip changes nothing. For a home goal the window also asks who scored and who assisted, and ticks those players as on the ice for you. Roster menu items reopen the window for the last home or away goal to fix it later.
- No plus/minus is given for goals scored while any penalty is active on either team. This can be turned off from the Roster menu.
- Game and season totals for plus/minus, goals, assists and points, with a Game / Season switch. New Game clears the game numbers and keeps the season numbers.
- Click a player to type in exact game and season numbers.
- New text files for overlays: `home_plus_minus.txt`, `home_season_plus_minus.txt`, `home_scoring.txt`, `home_season_scoring.txt` (lists the whole roster) and `last_goal.txt`. Columns line up in a fixed-width font.
- The roster and all numbers are kept across OBS restarts.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- Strength display — writes current players-per-side to `strength.txt` (e.g. `5-4`) based on active penalties or red cards, updated on every penalty lifecycle event (#11)
- Configurable "Players per side" in Game Settings — supports different game formats (5v5, 4v4, 3v3 hockey; 11v11, 7v7 soccer; etc.)
- Sport-aware strength calculation — hockey/lacrosse/rugby use running penalties, soccer uses red cards (`fouls2`)
- Strength label format template with `{{ home }}`, `{{ away }}`, and `{{ if_pp }}...{{ end_if }}` conditional, with live preview in Game Settings
- Sport preset defaults for base strength: Hockey 5, Soccer 11, Lacrosse 5, Rugby 15

### Changed
- Game Settings dialog is now scrollable and resizable

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- Cumulative game clock no longer drifts 1 second from the period clock — elapsed time is now derived from the displayed period clock, guaranteeing they always sum to the period length (#16)
- Cumulative game clock now persists across OBS restarts — previously reset to 0:00 every time OBS reopened

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Cumulative game clock — opt-in feature (Game Settings toggle) that counts up from 0:00 across the entire game, displayed under the period clock, written to `cumulative_clock.txt`, and used for event log timestamps when enabled (#12)
- Cumulative clock format setting — choose between `MM:SS` (e.g. 75:30) and `H:MM:SS` (e.g. 1:15:30) in Game Settings
- Combined penalty label files (`home_penalty_labels.txt`, `away_penalty_labels.txt`) with configurable format template including compound penalty support via `{{ if_phase2 }}` conditional; live preview in Game Settings (#14)
- `period_length.txt` file written and read by the scoreboard core — enables external tools (reeln-cli) to set a custom period length that persists across "New Game" and period advance
- `period_length.txt` added to the file watcher for automatic pickup of external changes

### Fixed
- "Game Finished" checkbox now resets when starting a new game — previously carried over from the prior game, causing the highlights button to show "Generate Game Highlights" instead of "Generate Period Highlights"
- Penalty chapter markers now correctly name the penalized team instead of the opposing team, and use the label "Penalty:" instead of "Power Play:" (#13)
- Clock adjustment on compound penalties now carries leftover time into phase 2 — previously a 60s subtraction on a 2+5 with 30s remaining would start phase 2 at 5:00 instead of the correct 4:30
- Game Settings dialog no longer resets the clock when saving non-clock settings (e.g. penalty format, CLI path)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- Compound penalty support (2+2, 2+5, 2+10) — two-phase penalties where phase 2 auto-starts when phase 1 expires, matching hockey rules for double-minor and major infractions
- Phase 2 toggle buttons (+2, +5, +10) in the add-penalty dialog — select one for compound, deselect all for regular; only shown for sports with major penalties (hockey, lacrosse, rugby)
- Compound indicator `(+M:SS)` shown in the dock UI for penalties still in phase 1
- Edit button (✏) on each active penalty row — click to change remaining time
- 4 new OBS hotkeys: Home/Away Penalty Edit 1/2 — opens edit dialog for the first or second running penalty
- 4 new OBS hotkeys: Home/Away 2+2 Penalty Add, Home/Away 2+5 Penalty Add — open add-penalty dialog with compound phase pre-selected
- `scoreboard_penalty_compact()` API — consolidates penalties to lowest slots after any clear or expiry
- `scoreboard_home_penalty_set_time()` / `scoreboard_away_penalty_set_time()` API for programmatic time edits
- JSON state persistence for `phase2_tenths` field (backwards compatible — old state files load with phase2 defaulting to 0)

### Fixed
- Clock adjust at 0:00 no longer reduces penalty time — pressing -1 min or -1 sec when the period clock is already at 0:00 was incorrectly subtracting time from active penalties
- File watcher re-read no longer wipes compound penalty phase 2 data — `parse_penalty_files` now preserves `phase2_tenths` across text file round-trips

### Changed
- Penalty hotkeys now open a dialog for player number entry instead of silently adding penalties with no player number — ensures every penalty is tracked to a player
- Clearing a compound penalty in phase 1 (via X button or Clear hotkey) transitions to phase 2 instead of removing the penalty entirely; clearing in phase 2 removes it as normal
- Editing a compound penalty's time to 0 transitions to phase 2 instead of clearing
- After clearing or expiring a penalty, remaining penalties consolidate to the lowest slots — "Clear 1" always targets the first remaining penalty regardless of which slot originally held it
- Hotkey penalty-add callbacks now dispatch to the Qt main thread via `QMetaObject::invokeMethod` for thread-safe dialog display
- Total OBS hotkeys increased from 37 to 45

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- Game clock now keeps accurate time — previously drifted fast due to assuming exactly 100ms between Qt timer fires instead of measuring actual elapsed wall-clock time
- "Generate Period Highlights" button now correctly runs `reeln game segment <N>` instead of `reeln game highlights` — the game highlights command requires individual segment files to exist first
- Highlights hotkey now also dispatches based on "Game Finished" checkbox state

### Changed
- Highlights button label now includes the period number (e.g. "Generate Period 1 Highlights") for clarity

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- Configurable period labels — period display names are now customizable per-game via `period_labels.txt`, with sport-specific defaults (e.g. hockey: 1, 2, 3, OT, OT2, OT3, OT4)
- "Edit..." button in Game Settings to open `period_labels.txt` in default text editor for quick customization
- File watcher on `period_labels.txt` — edits in external editors apply immediately without restarting OBS
- Faceoff wins counter for hockey and lacrosse — tracks home/away faceoff wins with +/- buttons, displayed below shots on goal
- `home_faceoffs.txt` and `away_faceoffs.txt` output files for OBS Text sources
- 4 new OBS hotkeys: Home/Away Faceoff Win +/-
- Tooltips on all stat row buttons and labels (SOG, FO) for discoverability
- Penalty queue system — only 2 penalties per team run simultaneously (matching hockey rules), additional penalties queue and auto-start when earlier ones expire
- `SCOREBOARD_MAX_RUNNING_PENALTIES` constant for configurable penalty concurrency

### Fixed
- Start/Stop button now resets to green "Start" when clock auto-stops at 0:00 — previously stayed red "Stop" until manually clicked
- Penalty timers now freeze when period clock reaches 0:00 — previously kept ticking after clock auto-stop

### Changed
- Period max is now derived from period label count instead of hardcoded segment_count + ot_max
- Toggling overtime on/off regenerates period labels and clamps current period accordingly
- Penalty text file output (`home_penalty_numbers.txt`, etc.) now shows only the 2 running penalties, not queued ones
- Dock UI shows all active penalties but marks queued penalties with "(queued)" suffix

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- "Copy Timestamps to Clipboard" button now remains visible after OBS restarts or stream stops, as long as `timestamps.txt` exists on disk
- reeln-cli commands (segment highlights, game highlights) now fire regardless of streaming state — previously the button did nothing when not actively streaming

### Changed
- New Game clears `timestamps.txt` and hides the copy button
- Stream start warns if previous game timestamps exist, with option to keep or start fresh

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- Game event timestamps for YouTube chapter markers — automatically logs goals, penalties, period changes, and game end events with stream-relative timestamps
- "Copy Timestamps to Clipboard" button for pasting chapter markers into YouTube descriptions
- `timestamps.txt` output file written incrementally after every event
- Event removal support: decrementing a score or clearing a penalty removes the corresponding timestamp entry
- Goal timestamps subtract a 10-second delay offset to better align with the actual moment
- Power Play labels on penalty events showing which team has the advantage
- Recording chapter markers — embeds chapters into Hybrid MP4/MOV recordings via OBS 32+ API when enabled (requires Hybrid MP4 output format, not Standard/FFmpeg)
- Companion `.chapters.txt` file written next to any recording (MP4 or MKV) for reeln-cli integration or manual ffmpeg chapter injection
- "Record chapters in game file" checkbox in Game Settings with tooltip showing API availability
- Sport-aware score labels in timestamps: "Goal" for hockey/soccer/lacrosse, "Try" for rugby; score logging disabled by default for basketball and football (too frequent)
- Clock auto-stop when it reaches 0:00 (count-down) or period length (count-up)
- Scrollable dock layout — process queue no longer pushes scoreboard controls out of view

### Changed
- Segment CLI command (`reeln game segment`) only runs when OBS is actively streaming — no more spurious failures during offline testing
- Process queue section now uses remaining dock space and scrolls internally instead of growing unbounded

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-03

### Changed
- Renamed "Streamn CLI" to "reeln-cli" in Game Settings dialog with clickable link to repository
- Simplified CLI integration: period advance fires `reeln game segment {period}` automatically
- Removed main config and override config fields (replaced by hardcoded reeln-cli commands)
- Removed auto-highlights checkbox (segment command fires automatically on period advance)
- Goal scoring and new game no longer fire CLI commands
- Highlights button and period advance are disabled while clock is running
- Highlights button text is now sport-aware (e.g. "Generate Quarter Highlights" for basketball)

### Added
- "CLI arguments" text field in Game Settings for extra args (e.g. `--profile my-profile`)
- Mid-period confirmation dialog when generating highlights or advancing period with clock stopped mid-segment
- "Game Finished" checkbox next to highlights button — switches to `reeln game highlights` command

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- Multi-sport support: hockey, basketball, soccer, football, lacrosse, rugby, and generic sport presets

- File watcher monitors `sport.txt` for external sport changes
- Foul/card/flag counter for basketball ("Fouls"), soccer ("YC"/"RC"), and football ("Flags") with +/- buttons in dock UI
- Soccer split yellow card (YC) and red card (RC) into separate counter rows
- `home_fouls.txt`, `away_fouls.txt`, `home_fouls2.txt`, `away_fouls2.txt` output files for foul counters
- Fouls and fouls2 persisted in JSON state and text file round-trips
- 8 new OBS hotkeys for foul counters: Home/Away Foul +/-, Home/Away Foul2 +/-
- Rugby preset: 2 halves, 40-minute periods, count-up clock, sin-bin penalties
- 31 new sport preset and foul tests (`test-scoreboard-core-sport.c`)

### Changed
- **Soccer: "Cards" counter split into "YC" (yellow cards) and "RC" (red cards).** `home_fouls.txt`/`away_fouls.txt` now represent yellow cards only. Add OBS Text sources for the new `home_fouls2.txt`/`away_fouls2.txt` files to display red cards.
- Period/overtime logic now driven by sport preset (segment count + OT max) instead of hardcoded hockey values
- Shots row automatically hides for sports without shots (basketball, soccer, football, generic)
- Penalty section automatically hides for sports without penalties (basketball, soccer, football, generic)
- Game Settings dialog label changed from "Period length" to "Segment length" to align with reeln-cli vernacular
- Sport dropdown in Game Settings live-previews default duration, direction, and penalty visibility
- Lacrosse preset includes penalty support (same timed model as hockey)
- Fouls row automatically shows for sports with fouls (basketball, soccer, football) with sport-specific label
- Second foul row (fouls2) automatically shows for soccer (red cards)

## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-02

- Updated README macOS install instructions with Gatekeeper workaround (right-click > Open)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

### Changed
- CMakeLists.txt refactored for cross-platform Qt5/Qt6/OBS/SIMDE discovery
- macOS build now links against OBS.app's bundled Qt6 frameworks when OBS.app is present, avoiding dual-Qt-runtime crash
- `configure.sh` auto-detects OBS.app and skips Homebrew Qt prefix when present (CI still uses qt@5)
- `QAction` include is now version-conditional (`QtGui` for Qt6, `QtWidgets` for Qt5)
- `merge_path_value()` now uses platform-correct PATH separator (`;` on Windows, `:` elsewhere)
- Compiler flags platform-gated: MSVC uses `/W4`, GCC/Clang uses `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic`
- Game Settings save now reloads CLI config (`load_cli_config()`) after updating paths
