## Features

- **7 sport presets** — hockey, basketball, soccer, football, lacrosse, rugby, and generic
- **32 text files** updated in real-time: clock, period, scores, shots, team names, penalties, penalty labels, fouls, home player plus/minus, goals and assists (game and season), sport, and more
- **Dock UI** with full scoreboard controls in an OBS dock panel
- **45 OBS hotkeys** for hands-free operation during broadcasts
- **Penalty tracking** with automatic countdown timers, compound penalties (2+2, 2+5, 2+10), edit/clear per slot (hockey, lacrosse, rugby)
- **Foul/card counters** for basketball, soccer, and football
- **reeln-cli integration** for automated highlight generation
- **Game event timestamps** — YouTube chapter markers copied to clipboard for livestream descriptions
- **Recording chapter markers** — game events written to a `.chapters.txt` companion file next to each recording; also embedded directly into Hybrid MP4/MOV recordings on OBS 32+
- **Cumulative game clock** — opt-in clock counting up from 0:00 across all periods, written to `cumulative_clock.txt`, with configurable display format (MM:SS or H:MM:SS)
- **Player plus/minus (+/-)** for hockey: add your team's roster, tap players on and off the ice, and every goal updates +/- automatically. Credit goals and assists to players and see this game's or the whole season's numbers (see [Plus/Minus Tracking](#plusminus-tracking))
- **Custom penalty labels** — combined penalty number + time in a single file per team (`home_penalty_labels.txt`, `away_penalty_labels.txt`) with configurable format template and compound penalty support

Build your own scorebug overlay using OBS Text sources pointed at the output files:

- **Windows** (x64)
- **Linux** (x86_64)
- C11 / C++17

## Installation

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/StreamnDad/streamn-scoreboard/releases) page. Each download contains a single plugin file (`.so`, `.dll`, or `.pkg`) that you copy into your OBS plugins folder.

For general information about installing OBS plugins, see the [OBS Plugins Guide](https://obsproject.com/kb/plugins-guide).

### macOS

1. Download `streamn-obs-scoreboard-x.y.z-macos.pkg`
2. **Right-click** (or Control-click) the `.pkg` file and choose **Open** — this is required because the package is not yet notarized with Apple. If you double-click instead, macOS will block it. You can also go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway** after a blocked attempt.
3. Follow the installer prompts
4. Restart OBS Studio

The installer places the plugin in `~/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/plugins/streamn-obs-scoreboard.plugin/`.

### Windows

1. Download `streamn-obs-scoreboard-x.y.z-windows-x64.zip`
2. Extract the `streamn-obs-scoreboard` folder to your OBS plugins directory:
   - **Recommended:** `C:\ProgramData\obs-studio\plugins\`
   - **Alternative:** Copy just the `.dll` from `bin\64bit\` to `C:\Program Files\obs-studio\obs-plugins\64bit\`
3. Restart OBS Studio

### Linux

1. Download `streamn-obs-scoreboard-x.y.z-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`
2. Extract the `streamn-obs-scoreboard` folder to your OBS plugins directory:
   - **Per-user:** `~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/`
   - **Alternative:** Copy just the `.so` from `bin/64bit/` to `/usr/lib/obs-plugins/`
3. Restart OBS Studio

### After installation

1. Open OBS Studio — the plugin loads automatically on startup
2. Go to **View > Docks > Streamn Scoreboard** to enable the dock panel
3. Dock it wherever you like in the OBS interface (drag the title bar to snap it into place)

### Uninstalling

**macOS:**
```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/plugins/streamn-obs-scoreboard.plugin
```

**Windows:** Delete `streamn-obs-scoreboard.dll` from your OBS plugins folder.

**Linux:**
```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/streamn-obs-scoreboard
# or, if installed system-wide:
sudo rm /usr/lib/obs-plugins/streamn-obs-scoreboard.so
```

Restart OBS after uninstalling.

### Building from source

```bash
# macOS
make setup                    # Install prerequisites (requires Homebrew)
make find-obs-dev-paths       # Discover local OBS header/lib paths
make dev OBS_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/obs/include OBS_LIBRARY=/path/to/libobs
make install

# Linux
sudo apt install libobs-dev qtbase5-dev libsimde-dev ninja-build
cmake --preset linux
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build

# Windows (requires Visual Studio 2022, Qt5, OBS SDK)
cmake --preset windows -DOBS_INCLUDE_DIR=... -DOBS_LIBRARY=... -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=...
cmake --build build --config RelWithDebInfo
ctest --test-dir build -C RelWithDebInfo
```

## Text Files

Set an output directory in the dock settings. The plugin writes these files on every tick (~100ms):

| File | Content | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `clock.txt` | Game clock | `12:45` |
| `period.txt` | Current period | `2` / `OT` |
| `home_name.txt` | Home team name | `Eagles` |
| `away_name.txt` | Away team name | `Hawks` |
| `home_score.txt` | Home score | `3` |
| `away_score.txt` | Away score | `1` |
| `home_shots.txt` | Home shots on goal | `18` |
| `away_shots.txt` | Away shots on goal | `12` |
| `home_penalty_numbers.txt` | Home penalty player numbers | `#12 #7` |
| `home_penalty_times.txt` | Home penalty times remaining | `1:32 0:45` |
| `away_penalty_numbers.txt` | Away penalty player numbers | `#19` |
| `away_penalty_times.txt` | Away penalty times remaining | `0:22` |

| `away_fouls2.txt` | Away second counter (e.g. red cards) | `1` |
| `sport.txt` | Active sport preset | `hockey` |
| `home_penalty_labels.txt` | Combined penalty number + time (one per line) | `#12  1:32` |
| `away_penalty_labels.txt` | Combined penalty number + time (one per line) | `#19  0:22` |
| `home_plus_minus.txt` | Home roster, +/- this game (one per line) | `#12    +2` |
| `home_season_plus_minus.txt` | Home roster, +/- for the season | `#12   +14` |
| `home_scoring.txt` | Players with a goal or assist this game | `#12   1G  2A  3P` |
| `home_season_scoring.txt` | Whole roster with season goals, assists and points | `#12   9G 12A 21P` |
| `last_goal.txt` | Who scored the latest credited goal and who assisted | `Eagles goal: #12 (assists: #7, #9)` |
| `home_faceoffs.txt` | Home faceoff wins | `8` |
| `away_faceoffs.txt` | Away faceoff wins | `6` |
| `cumulative_clock.txt` | Cumulative game clock (when enabled) | `32:15` |
| `period_length.txt` | Period length in seconds | `900` |
| `period_labels.txt` | Period display names | `1,2,3,OT` |
| `default_penalty_duration.txt` | Minor penalty duration (seconds) | `120` |
| `default_major_penalty_duration.txt` | Major penalty duration (seconds) | `300` |

Not all files are relevant for every sport — shots are only tracked for hockey and lacrosse, penalties for hockey/lacrosse/rugby, and fouls for basketball/soccer/football. Files for inactive features still exist but won't change.

## Plus/Minus, Goals and Assists

For hockey, the dock has one button, **Player Stats / Roster...**. It opens a separate **Home Players** window with the whole roster, two players per row. The window stays open while you work and updates by itself. Only your home team's players are tracked. The away team is not.

1. In the Home Players window, click **Roster...** and choose **Add players...**. Type the jersey numbers separated by spaces or commas (for example `4 7 12, 19`). You can add up to 30 players.
2. Score as usual. After each goal, home or away, a small window asks **who was on the ice**. Tick the players. Every box starts empty for each new goal, nothing is remembered from the last one. Press **OK** to save, or **Skip** to leave everything alone (nobody gets any +/- for that goal).
3. For a home goal the same window also asks who scored and who got up to two assists.

Each row in the Home Players window reads like `#12    +2   1G  2A  3P` (jersey number, +/-, goals, assists, points). The **Game / Season** switch at the top changes whether the rows show this game or the whole season. Click a row to edit that player.

- **Plus/minus:** a home goal gives +1 to the players you ticked, and an away goal gives them -1.
- **No +/- during penalties:** if any penalty is active on either team when a goal is scored (power play, shorthanded or 4 on 4), nobody gets a +/- for that goal. Goals, assists and the score still count. The goal window tells you when this happens. You can turn this rule off with **Roster... > No +/- for goals during penalties**.
- **Game numbers** start at zero for each game (**New Game** clears them but keeps the roster).
- **Season numbers** keep adding up from game to game. Anything that changes a game number (a goal, or an edit) changes the season number by the same amount. Use **Roster... > Reset season totals (new season)** when a new season starts.
- **Manual changes:** click a player (or right-click for more) and choose **Edit** to type in exact game and season +/-, goals and assists. If you only change a game number, the season number follows. If you type a season number, it is used as typed.
- **Fixing a goal later:** **Roster... > Last home goal...** and **Last away goal...** reopen the window for the most recent goal. The on-ice boxes show who was already named, so you can change them and the +/- moves to the right players. Leave scorer and assists on "(nobody)" to keep the credit already there. You can turn the window off with **Roster... > Ask about each goal**.
- Taking a goal back with the score "-" button removes its credit and +/- changes. Typing a score in directly, or editing the score files, cannot be matched to earlier goals, so those are not reversed.
- The roster and all numbers are remembered when you restart OBS.
- For your overlay, point a Text source at `home_plus_minus.txt` or `home_season_plus_minus.txt` for the whole roster, `home_scoring.txt` for this game's goals and assists, `home_season_scoring.txt` for the whole roster's season points, or `last_goal.txt` for a "who just scored" line. Use a fixed-width font (like Consolas or Courier New) in the Text source so the columns line up.

## Game Event Timestamps & Recording Chapters

The plugin automatically tracks game events (goals, penalties, period changes) with timestamps relative to your stream or recording start time.

### Livestream Timestamps (YouTube Chapters)

When OBS is streaming, events are logged with stream-relative timestamps. Click **Copy Timestamps to Clipboard** in the dock to paste them into your YouTube video description as chapter markers:

```
0:00:00 Stream Start
0:12:34 Period 1 Start
0:15:22 Goal: Eagles (1-0)
0:23:45 Penalty: Hawks #12
0:35:10 Period 1 End
```

A `timestamps.txt` file is also written to your output directory after every event.

### Recording Chapters

Enable **"Record chapters in game file"** in Game Settings to track events in your local recordings:

- **Companion file**: A `.chapters.txt` file is written next to every recording (e.g., `2026-03-12_15-30-00.mp4.chapters.txt`). This works with any recording format (MKV, MP4, MOV) and can be used by reeln-cli or with ffmpeg to inject chapters.
- **Embedded MP4 chapters**: On OBS 32+, chapters are also embedded directly into the recording file — but **only** when using the **Hybrid MP4** recording format. Standard (FFmpeg) output and MKV do not support embedded chapters. To enable: OBS Settings > Output > Recording > Recording Format > **Hybrid MP4**.

Recording chapters are tracked independently of streaming, so they work when you're only recording locally without a livestream.

### Sport-Aware Score Events

Score events use sport-specific labels:

| Sport | Label | Logged by default |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| Hockey | Goal | Yes |
| Soccer | Goal | Yes |
| Lacrosse | Goal | Yes |
| Rugby | Try | Yes |
| Basketball | Score | No (too frequent) |
| Football | Score | No (too frequent) |

Period, penalty, and game-end events are always logged regardless of sport.

## Development

```bash
make dev          # configure + build + test (full cycle)
make coverage     # enforce 100% line coverage on scoreboard-core
make release      # build macOS .pkg installer
make clean        # remove build artifacts
```

### Architecture

Two-layer design separating testable core logic from OBS-dependent code:

- **scoreboard-core** (C static library) — pure game state management, file output, no OBS dependencies
- **OBS module** (C/C++ shared library) — dock UI, hotkeys, OBS integration

Tests are plain C using `assert()` with 100% line coverage on the core library.
