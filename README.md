## Features

- **7 sport presets** — hockey, basketball, soccer, football, lacrosse, rugby, and generic
- **34 text files** updated in real-time: clock, period, scores, shots, team names, penalties, penalty labels, fouls, plus/minus, goals and assists, on-ice players, sport, and more
- **Dock UI** with full scoreboard controls in an OBS dock panel
- **45 OBS hotkeys** for hands-free operation during broadcasts
- **Penalty tracking** with automatic countdown timers, compound penalties (2+2, 2+5, 2+10), edit/clear per slot (hockey, lacrosse, rugby)
- **Foul/card counters** for basketball, soccer, and football
- **reeln-cli integration** for automated highlight generation
- **Game event timestamps** — YouTube chapter markers copied to clipboard for livestream descriptions
- **Recording chapter markers** — game events written to a `.chapters.txt` companion file next to each recording; also embedded directly into Hybrid MP4/MOV recordings on OBS 32+
- **Cumulative game clock** — opt-in clock counting up from 0:00 across all periods, written to `cumulative_clock.txt`, with configurable display format (MM:SS or H:MM:SS)
- **Player plus/minus (+/-)** for hockey: add a roster per team, tap players on and off the ice, and every goal updates +/- automatically, and you can credit goals and assists to players (see [Plus/Minus Tracking](#plusminus-tracking))
- **Custom penalty labels** — combined penalty number + time in a single file per team (`home_penalty_labels.txt`, `away_penalty_labels.txt`) with configurable format template and compound penalty support

Build your own scorebug overlay using OBS Text sources pointed at the output files:

## Compatibility

- **OBS Studio** 30.0+ (Qt5/Qt6); embedded recording chapters require OBS 32+ with Hybrid MP4 output
- **macOS** (Apple Silicon and Intel)
- **Windows** (x64)
- **Linux** (x86_64)
- C11 / C++17

## Installation

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/StreamnDad/streamn-scoreboard/releases) page. Each download contains a single plugin file (`.so`, `.dll`, or `.pkg`) that you copy into your OBS plugins folder.

For general information about installing OBS plugins, see the [OBS Plugins Guide](https://obsproject.com/kb/plugins-guide).

### macOS

1. Download `streamn-obs-scoreboard-x.y.z-macos.pkg`
2. **Right-click** (or Control-click) the `.pkg` file and choose **Open** — this is required because the package is not yet notarized with Apple. If you double-click instead, macOS will block it. You can also go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway** after a blocked attempt.
3. Follow the installer prompts
4. Restart OBS Studio

The installer places the plugin in `~/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/plugins/streamn-obs-scoreboard.plugin/`.

### Windows

1. Download `streamn-obs-scoreboard-x.y.z-windows-x64.zip`
2. Extract the `streamn-obs-scoreboard` folder to your OBS plugins directory:
   - **Recommended:** `C:\ProgramData\obs-studio\plugins\`
   - **Alternative:** Copy just the `.dll` from `bin\64bit\` to `C:\Program Files\obs-studio\obs-plugins\64bit\`
3. Restart OBS Studio

### Linux

1. Download `streamn-obs-scoreboard-x.y.z-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`
2. Extract the `streamn-obs-scoreboard` folder to your OBS plugins directory:
   - **Per-user:** `~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/`
   - **Alternative:** Copy just the `.so` from `bin/64bit/` to `/usr/lib/obs-plugins/`
3. Restart OBS Studio

### After installation

1. Open OBS Studio — the plugin loads automatically on startup
2. Go to **View > Docks > Streamn Scoreboard** to enable the dock panel
3. Dock it wherever you like in the OBS interface (drag the title bar to snap it into place)

### Uninstalling

**macOS:**
```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/plugins/streamn-obs-scoreboard.plugin
```

**Windows:** Delete `streamn-obs-scoreboard.dll` from your OBS plugins folder.

**Linux:**
```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/streamn-obs-scoreboard
# or, if installed system-wide:
sudo rm /usr/lib/obs-plugins/streamn-obs-scoreboard.so
```

Restart OBS after uninstalling.

### Building from source

```bash
# macOS
make setup                    # Install prerequisites (requires Homebrew)
make find-obs-dev-paths       # Discover local OBS header/lib paths
make dev OBS_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/obs/include OBS_LIBRARY=/path/to/libobs
make install

# Linux
sudo apt install libobs-dev qtbase5-dev libsimde-dev ninja-build
cmake --preset linux

| `home_plus_minus.txt` | Home roster with +/- (one per line) | `#12  +2` |
| `away_plus_minus.txt` | Away roster with +/- (one per line) | `#19  -1` |
| `home_on_ice.txt` | Home players on the ice with +/- (one per line) | `#12  +2` |
| `away_on_ice.txt` | Away players on the ice with +/- (one per line) | `#19  -1` |
| `home_scoring.txt` | Home players with a goal or assist (one per line) | `#12  1G 2A` |
| `away_scoring.txt` | Away players with a goal or assist (one per line) | `#9  2G 0A` |
| `last_goal.txt` | Who scored the latest credited goal and who assisted | `Eagles goal: #12 (assists: #7, #9)` |

| `default_penalty_duration.txt` | Minor penalty duration (seconds) | `120` |
| `default_major_penalty_duration.txt` | Major penalty duration (seconds) | `300` |

Not all files are relevant for every sport — shots are only tracked for hockey and lacrosse, penalties for hockey/lacrosse/rugby, and fouls for basketball/soccer/football. Files for inactive features still exist but won't change.

## Plus/Minus Tracking

For hockey, the dock has an on-ice section under the penalties, one column per team.

1. Click **Roster...** under a team and choose **Add players...**. Type the jersey numbers separated by spaces or commas (for example `4 7 12, 19`). You can add up to 30 players per team.
2. Click a player's button to put them on the ice (the button turns bold and the title shows how many are on). Click again to take them off. **Clear Ice** takes everyone off.
3. Score as usual. Each goal gives +1 to the scoring team's on-ice players and -1 to the other team's on-ice players.

Good to know:

- **Power-play goals are skipped** by default (the scoring team had more players on the ice because of a penalty). Shorthanded and even-strength goals count. Turn this off with **Roster... > Skip power-play goals**.
- **Taking a goal back** with the score "-" button reverses the +/- changes it made, for the same players, even if the lines have changed since. Typing a score in directly, or editing the score files, cannot be matched to earlier goals, so those are not reversed. You can also fix one player by right-clicking their button (add 1, subtract 1, or remove them from the roster).
- **New Game** clears every +/- and takes everyone off the ice, but keeps the rosters.
- Rosters, who is on the ice, and the +/- totals are remembered when you restart OBS.
- **Type in exact numbers:** right-click a player and choose **Edit #N...** to set their +/-, goals and assists directly.
- **Goals and assists:** after you press a team's goal "+" button (or its hotkey), a small window asks who scored and who got the assists. Pick the players, or press **Skip** to leave it. If you press the goal button by mistake, the "-" button also removes that goal's credit. You can credit a goal later with **Roster... > Credit last goal...**, and turn the pop-up off with **Roster... > Ask who scored after each goal**. Player buttons show their goals and assists under the number, and hovering shows the full line.
- For an overlay, point a Text source at `home_scoring.txt` or `away_scoring.txt` for a goals and assists list, or at `last_goal.txt` for a "who just scored" line.
- For your overlay, point a Text source at `home_plus_minus.txt` or `away_plus_minus.txt` to show the whole roster, or at `home_on_ice.txt` or `away_on_ice.txt` to show only the players on the ice right now.

## Game Event Timestamps & Recording Chapters

The plugin automatically tracks game events (goals, penalties, period changes) with timestamps relative to your stream or recording start time.

### Livestream Timestamps (YouTube Chapters)

When OBS is streaming, events are logged with stream-relative timestamps. Click **Copy Timestamps to Clipboard** in the dock to paste them into your YouTube video description as chapter markers:

```
0:00:00 Stream Start
0:12:34 Period 1 Start
0:15:22 Goal: Eagles (1-0)
0:23:45 Penalty: Hawks #12
0:35:10 Period 1 End
```

A `timestamps.txt` file is also written to your output directory after every event.

### Recording Chapters

Enable **"Record chapters in game file"** in Game Settings to track events in your local recordings:

- **Companion file**: A `.chapters.txt` file is written next to every recording (e.g., `2026-03-12_15-30-00.mp4.chapters.txt`). This works with any recording format (MKV, MP4, MOV) and can be used by reeln-cli or with ffmpeg to inject chapters.
- **Embedded MP4 chapters**: On OBS 32+, chapters are also embedded directly into the recording file — but **only** when using the **Hybrid MP4** recording format. Standard (FFmpeg) output and MKV do not support embedded chapters. To enable: OBS Settings > Output > Recording > Recording Format > **Hybrid MP4**.

Recording chapters are tracked independently of streaming, so they work when you're only recording locally without a livestream.

### Sport-Aware Score Events

Score events use sport-specific labels:

| Sport | Label | Logged by default |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| Hockey | Goal | Yes |
| Soccer | Goal | Yes |
| Lacrosse | Goal | Yes |
| Rugby | Try | Yes |
| Basketball | Score | No (too frequent) |
| Football | Score | No (too frequent) |

Period, penalty, and game-end events are always logged regardless of sport.

## Development

```bash
make dev          # configure + build + test (full cycle)
make coverage     # enforce 100% line coverage on scoreboard-core
make release      # build macOS .pkg installer
make clean        # remove build artifacts
```

### Architecture

Two-layer design separating testable core logic from OBS-dependent code:

- **scoreboard-core** (C static library) — pure game state management, file output, no OBS dependencies
- **OBS module** (C/C++ shared library) — dock UI, hotkeys, OBS integration

Tests are plain C using `assert()` with 100% line coverage on the core library.
